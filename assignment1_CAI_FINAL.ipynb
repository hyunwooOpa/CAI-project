    "## Conversational AI (25/26) Assignment 1: LLM inference in task-oriented dialogues\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are being widely deployed as dialogue systems, e.g. QA systems. \n",
    "In this assignment, we will be loading a large language model (Qwen3) and using it for task-oriented conversational modeling with subjective knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DSTC11 Task 5 and its dataset are explained in detail [here](https://github.com/alexa/dstc11-track5). Also, you can read more about it in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12091).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the task is to respond to subjective user requests regarding hotels and restaurants, e.g., \"does the restaurant have a nice vibe?\". Our conversational model has to generate a response to this question based on conversation history and previous reviews it has access to. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task consists of three sub-tasks: \n",
    "1. Knowledge-seeking Turn Detection\n",
    "2. Knowledge Selection\n",
    "3. **Knowledge-grounded Response Generation** (our focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on the last sub-task, _knowledge-grounded response generation_, for which we need the dialog history, request, and knowledge. With these as the input, the model should then generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook contains the following parts:**\n",
    "1. Exploring the DSTC11 Task5 data and formatting it in the proper structure\n",
    "2. Off-the-shelf inference with Qwen3-1.7B\n",
    "3. Analyzing the model behavior"

    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the dialogue history between a user and a system to have Qwen generate a response to a knowledge-seeking request from the user. \n",
    "The goal is to load an LLM and understand the strengths and limitations of its off-the-shelf usage for task-oriented dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, you will find questions you need to answer to complete the assignment. These are both coding questions and questions that evaluate your understanding of the data, the process, and the model behavior. These questions are indicated as  **<span style=\"background:yellow\">Q#</span>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment steps:**\n",
    "1. Load the dataset and understand its structure, individual components, what the inputs should be and what the output should be. **(Q1)**\n",
    "2. Convert the dataset to a structure that is useful for our LLM to generate its responses with. **(Q2 - Q4)**\n",
    "4. Answer questions about the assignment, based on your implementation and manual analysis of 10 samples. **(Q5 - Q9)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "Please submit your code (as a Kaggle notebook) on Canvas by **3rd November 23:59**.\n",

    "## A couple of notes about Kaggle notebooks\n",
    "* [Terms and conditions](https://www.kaggle.com/terms)\n",
    "* Short note on the [GPU limits](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/108481)\n",
    "* [Uploading your own model to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/63328)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle directories** may be confusing because they are present on another machine that we have no access to (effectively \"in the cloud\"). \n",
    "To help your orientation, keep this in mind:\n",
    "* Input data files are available in the read-only \"/kaggle/input/\" directory\n",
    "* You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n",
    "* You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle seems to run smoothly, including in terms of GPUs. There are two common environment issues that happen because we forget to turn on the internet or the GPUs. Specifically:\n",
    "* `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ... (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for ...` - to solve this issue, turn your notebook Internet ON.\n",
    "Make sure your accelerator is set to `GPU P100` or `GPU T4x2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:red\">Important</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are five good practices when working with Kaggle notebooks:\n",
    "1. Pay attention to usage statistics, especially memory, CPU, and GPU\n",
    "2. Pay attention to the quota of GPU (measured in hours)\n",
    "3. \"Turn OFF\" the internet after each session. Turn on the internet when starting a session.\n",
    "4. \"Turn off\" the accelerator after each use. Turn the accelerator on when starting a session.\n",
    "5. Save a version after you make changes. This ensures that your teammate can see the latest changes. If you get a question from Kaggle about versions, you can revert to the latest version."

This discrepancy suggests that the model could have been outweight engaging and pleasing output rather than representing the real feedback from the knowledge given from reviewers, which means that the model positively biased during the training for some reasons. Moreover, the model could provide far-fetched details on the response which were not supported by the knowledge, in the 'dataset[1]' for instance, the responses contained extra details about the Curry Garden's outdoor dining area 'beautiful garden' in a 'relaxed and scenic setting'.

In brief dialogues, the model is able to perform reasonably well, generating concise and contextually accurate replies. For example, in 'dataset[1]' the model effectively responds to the query about Curry Garden's outdoor dining area. Although, in long dialogues, such as 'dataset[20] the model had trouble to maintain coherence and relevance; it generated a response which included some extra details that were not supported by the knowledge as well as the ground_truth. This phenomenon suggests that while the model is able to extract information from extended dialogues in some degree, however, the relevance and coherence may decrease as the number of turns increases suggesting the model loses important contextual elements for analysis. This limitations suggests a key area for future research should be improving the model's ability to maintain context and coherence in complex, multi-turn dialogues."
