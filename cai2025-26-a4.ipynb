    "# Conversational AI (25/26) Assignment 4: Prompting\n",
    "This notebook uses Qwen to generate a dialogue utterance by providing various instructions. \n",
    "The dataset used in the assignment is the one from [DSTC11's task 5](https://github.com/lkra/dstc11-track5/blob/main/data), same as assignments 1-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "In this assignment, we will load a large language model (Qwen) and ask it to generate a dialogue response using different instructions and examples. \n",
    "The notebook compares three different prompting techniques:\n",
    "* Zero-shot prompting\n",
    "* Few-shot prompting\n",
    "* Chain-of-Thought prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these techniques, we explore how to interact with the model, design prompts, and interpret the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In addition to the most common approaches, there are other, less widely adopted prompting techniques, such as *CARP* (Chain-of-Thought with Retrieval Augmented Prompting) or *LPP* (Least-to-Most Prompting). It is important to remember that prompting is a flexible strategy that can be tailored to the specific needs of classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implementation of three popular prompting methods (from lecture 4)\n",
    "2. Evaluation with multiple metrics (from assignment 3)\n",
    "3. Analyzing the model behavior across configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, review this notebook to ensure you understand its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, you will find questions you need to answer to complete the assignment. These are both coding questions and questions that evaluate your understanding of the data, the process, and the model behavior. These questions are indicated as <span style=\"background:blue\">__Q#__</span>. This notebook contains 9 such questions and tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete the prompting function and run zero- and few-shot prompting with Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen3-1.7B. **(Q1, Q2)**\n",
    "2. Compare zero-and few-shot performance of Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen3-1.7B. **(Q3)**\n",
    "3. Complete the chain-of-thought code. **(Q4)**\n",
    "4. Answer the questions about the comparison of the methods. **(Q5 - Q9)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "Please submit your code (as a Kaggle notebook) on Canvas by **24th November 23:59**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading:** The assignment is graded with a pass/fail grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminders about Kaggle notebooks\n",
    "1. Pay attention to usage statistics, especially memory, CPU, and GPU\n",
    "2. Pay attention to the quota of GPU (measured in hours)\n",
    "3. \"Turn OFF\" the internet after each session. Turn on the internet when starting a session.\n",
    "4. \"Turn off\" the accelerator after each use. Turn the accelerator on when starting a session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ready?\n",
    "Let's get started! There are four preparations we will start with:\n",
    "1. installing packages\n",
    "2. importing relevant packages\n",
    "3. setting up the directory with the task data\n",
    "4. defining auxiliary LLM functions"

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaggle notebooks use a Python 3 environment, and they are already \"pre-loaded\" with various analytic Python packages, like Json, Pandas, and Numpy. If you are curious, you can see the package definition in [this repository](https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will install a few specialized packages for evaluation and for working with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just double check that Python is set up and we are using a relatively new version (like 3.10):"
